# arsenal-script-no-gui
There is my arsenal little scipt if u want to use i advise you to copy paste the scipt and not to do that :

loadstring(game:httpget('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kizza2/arsenal-script-no-gui/main/Aimlock%20(leftclick)'))()
loadstring(game:httpget('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kizza2/arsenal-script-no-gui/main/Box%20ESP'))()

))

Cause i think he doesn't work. But if u copy and past 1 per 1 it gonna work good !! 
See you ASAP
